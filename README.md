# ModalWindow
Learned about Model Windows. Modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. 

Useing event handlers and class list, this project has three buttons that when click a modal window will appear and blur out the background. 

The model window can be closd with clicking outside of the modal window, the "x" or the esc key
